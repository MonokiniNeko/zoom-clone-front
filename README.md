# zoom-clone-front

download expo and start the project with "expo start"
https://expo.dev/

scan the QR Code with the Expo Go app on your smartphone

If you want to test it on browser, use the "desktop-version" branch


Most of the buttons are purely decorative except the "Start meeting" on the first screen and the "Chat" button on the Meeting Screen"

The app will work without a Backend, but you'll find it on https://github.com/MonokiniNeko/zoom-clone-back and can be tested with the desktop version


# Purpose of this project

I made this project to have a better understanding of socket.io, to learn React Native and the use of a camera on an mobile app and a web app.

# My conclusion

Even if React Native is not as powerful as I first thought, I now have a better knowledge about its capacities and limit and I think it must be used alongside ReactJS and not replace it.
